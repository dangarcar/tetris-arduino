# tetris-arduino
A Tetris-based game made with Arduino Mega, ILI9486 TFT Shield and a car mp3 player.
It has been developed with PlatformIO and VS Code.

# How it works
When the game starts, the car mp3 player starts, reading an SD card that has the Tetris song in it, so it plays it. It keeps playing until the game is over. The mp3 player doesn't have speakers, so you have to 
you have to tune a radio to 87.5 mhz, because that's the frequency it emits.
